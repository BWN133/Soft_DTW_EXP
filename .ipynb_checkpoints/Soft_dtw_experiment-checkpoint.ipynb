    "We use ResNet-50 [25] as our backbone network and ex- tract features from the output of the Conv4c layer. The ex- tracted features have dimensions of 14×14×1024. We then stack k context frame features along the temporal dimen- sion for each frame. Next, the combined features are passed through two 3D convolutional layers for aggregating tem- poral information. It is then followed by a 3D global max pooling layer, two fully-connected layers, and a linear pro- jection layer to output embedding frames, with each having 128 dimensions. We resize input video frames to 224 × 224 before feeding to our encoder network."
